## What is an HD Wallet?

A Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that generates a tree-like structure of private/public keys (addresses) from a single seed. The seed is a random set of words that acts as the root of the tree, from which all the keys can be derived. This allows for the generation of a large number of unique addresses without the need to store each individual key. 

Additionally, if the seed is backed up, the entire tree of keys can be easily restored, making it a more secure and convenient way of managing multiple crypto assets.

:::info DRAFT DOCUMENTATION NOTICE

Please be aware that this document is currently a draft and is undergoing
active development. Content, guidelines, and instructions may be subject to
change.

:::caution ðŸš§ ALPHA CODE NOTICE ðŸš§

This application is in the alpha phase of development. It is important to note
that during this stage, breaking changes may occur without advance notice.
Users should proceed with caution.

## Introduction

This document guides you through the installation of the Camino Messenger Bot
using two distinct methods. The first method involves [compiling the
software](#compiling-from-source) from its source code, while the second
method [utilizes Docker](#building-docker-image) to create an image and run a
container.

## Compiling from Source

### Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.

**Ubuntu 22.04 LTS:**

```sh
sudo apt install libolm-dev
sudo snap install go --classic
```

### Get the Source

To get started, clone the Camino Messenger Bot repository and initialize the
submodules:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chain4travel/camino-messenger-bot.git
cd camino-messenger-bot
git submodule update --init
```

### Install Go Dependencies

Install the required Go dependencies with:

```sh
go mod download
```

### Build

Compile the application using the following command:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh
```

This will create a compiled binary under the `build` directory.

### Verify

To ensure the build was successful, check for the `camino-messenger-bot` binary:

```
./build/camino-messenger-bot --help
```

Running `camino-messenger-bot --help` should produce the following output:

```
$ ./build/camino-messenger-bot --help
starts camino messenger bot

## Building Docker Image

Follow these steps to build the Docker image.

### Get the Source

First, clone the Camino Messenger Bot repository and initialize the
submodules:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chain4travel/camino-messenger-bot.git
cd camino-messenger-bot
git submodule update --init
```

### Build the Image

Use the following command to build the Docker image:

```sh
docker build --tag camino-messenger-bot .
```

After a successful build, test the image with:

```sh
docker run --rm camino-messenger-bot --help
```

The expected output should be:

```
Usage of ./camino-messenger-bot:
  -config string
    	Path to configuration file
```

## Networking

To enable the bot to connect to the Camino Messenger server, ensure that the network
infrastructure and firewall rules are properly configured. The host running the bot
must be able to resolve DNS names and establish a connection with at least the
configured Matrix server. For internal communication with the Partner Plugin, ensure
that the hosts can reach each other and that firewall rules allow the necessary
applications to communicate.

### Bot-Plugin Connection Scenarios

- **Bot in Docker Container, Plugin on Host Machine (localhost):**  
  In the bot configuration for the plugin host, use `host.docker.internal`.

- **Bot in Docker Container, Plugin in Another Docker Container:**  
  In the bot configuration for the plugin host, use the service name of the plugin
  as defined in the Docker Compose file.

- **Bot Executable on Host Machine, Plugin on Host Machine:**  
  In the bot configuration for the plugin host, use `localhost`.

## Known Issues & Limitations

The following known issues should be considered when using the Camino Messenger Bot
v10.2.0:

### Version: v10.2.0

- **Start-Up Delay:** After a fresh start, the bot requires 10 to 15 seconds to
  initialize before it can send or receive messages on some systems. This delay may
  increase depending on network conditions, especially if the bot receives messages
  during this initialization period.

- **Crash on Empty Message:** The bot crashes if it receives an empty message, which
  should never occur. The Partner Plugin is responsible for sanitizing such
  messages. In the future, validation for empty messages and other relevant message
  types will be implemented using the protovalidate library.

- **Single Bot Contact Limitation:** Currently, only the first bot returned by the
  CM-Account is contacted by other bots. This limitation will be addressed in future
  updates to support High Availability and Failover within the Camino Messenger
  architecture.

- **Crash on Plugin Disconnection:** If the Partner Plugin disconnects while the bot
  receives a message, the bot may crash. As a workaround, use the `--restart always`
  flag when running the bot in a Docker container.

- **Mandatory Response Header Field:** The status field in the message response header
  is mandatory and should indicate either "success" or "failure". This requirement
  will be enforced once the protovalidate library is implemented.
